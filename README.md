Big Button Android aosp music player.

This is the default music player from the Android AOSP project
The source code from the Android Project can be found here:

Even though the aosp music player is simpler than most other players, it has developed through the years and has full functionality for albums, playlists and album art.
This is a modification for a car head unit (running 1024x600 at around 160 dpi)

There are a couple of modifications:
* BIG BUTTONS. *(see below)* To make it easier to tap your screen while driving without having to be "sharpshooter".
* Increased fonts and album art in the main player screen. *(see below)*
* The notification is clearer and has the album art visible on it.
* The lockscreen shows the default album art if there's no album art found for a song.
